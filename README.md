# afghanistan-form
Single file HTML/JS/CSS form for local use to generate structured text submission to USG.

# Usage
This form is meant to help streamline data flow for tracking of at-risk people in Afghanistan.

1. Download to your computer
2. Open in your browser (double-click file)
3. Fill out information in the form
4. Click submit
* This should generate an email with the form information in the body
6. Send the email

Adding a reliable structure to the data being submitted to Department of State will enable quicker analysis of the data and a faster response to the need.

#TODO:
- Create form that captures all data in 'info_reqts.txt'
- Include free-text 'additional information' box
- Include tag/label in generated text to indicate versioning of form to allow future growth and backward compatibility
- Consider hard coding Dept of State email submission address in form (or allowing user input)
- Include 'clear form' for repeated entries without close/reopen
