Fellow Americans, we are faced with the monumental challenge of locating and recovering fellow Americans and our Afghan friends. As Afghanistan falls more solidly under the control of the Taliban, our ability to communicate with at-risk people will decrease. From the volume of information flooding into the Departments of State and Defense and congressional offices, it's clear everyone wants to help. 

However, for every hand-written email with critical information, there's a person who has to manually copy information into another format. This flood of information won't be turned into meaningful action until all the critical information is combined. By using this email formatter, you can share your information in a way a computer can process. As we can transition processing information to computers, we can put our human creativity and potential toward using this information to helping our fellow citizens and friends.

You can help - 
Enter as much information as you can, click "SUBMIT", click "SEND" to ACTF@state.gov.
Call your senator/congressman's office and ask if they're using this tool to submit information to the State Department
